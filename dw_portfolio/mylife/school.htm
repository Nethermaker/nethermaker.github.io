			<p>I went to Cavett Elementary School for all of Kindergarten through 5th grade, and Scott Middle School for 6th through 8th grade.</p>
			<p>At Cavett I learned what it means to be nice to others. At Scott I learned that homework is important but I wish homework now is as easy as it was back then.</p>
