			<h2>Land and Climate</h2>
			<p>The United States stretches across the central portion of North America and includes Alaska, which is located in the far northwest and separated from the rest of the country by Canada, and the Hawaiian Islands, in the Pacific Ocean. Because of its size and location, the United States has a variety of geographical features and climates. Imposing mountains, vast deserts, wide canyons, extensive coasts, subtropical forests, wetlands, prairies, rolling hills, and tundra are all part of the country's natural diversity. Beyond the beaches and mountains of California, the Rocky Mountains, in the west, give way to a vast central plain, which merges with the rolling hills and low mountains of the east. Hawaii's rugged volcanic topography is lush and green year-round. Alaska has a varied landscape, with towering mountains, broad valleys, and glaciers. The country's natural resources include coal, copper, lead, uranium, bauxite, gold, silver, iron, petroleum, natural gas, and timber.</p>

			<p>Climates throughout the country are as varied as the terrain, ranging from subtropical in southern regions to arctic in the north. East of the Mississippi River, the climate is generally more humid, while western areas are more arid. Natural disasters such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe winter storms affect various regions.</p>
