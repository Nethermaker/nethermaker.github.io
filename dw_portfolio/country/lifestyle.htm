			<h2>Housing</h2>
			<p>Suburban houses are usually one or two storeys and have three to five bedrooms on average. Houses are often surrounded by grass lawns and gardens. Things like trampolines, basketball hoops, and—among wealthier families—swimming pools provide entertainment. Houses located within city limits tend to be smaller, and apartment, condo, and townhouse living is common in urban areas.</p>

			<p>Building materials tend to vary by region, with wood being common in earthquake-prone areas, adobe prevalent in the southwest, and brick and siding popular throughout the country. Energy-efficient materials and styles are growing in popularity. Many Americans enjoy adding on to and improving their homes.</p>

			<p>Some Americans may move from one region of the country to another for education, employment, or a change in living conditions, though the majority of Americans are less mobile and are likely to live near family.</p>

			<p>For nearly two-thirds of American families, the "American Dream" of owning a home is a reality. However, home ownership rates tend to be lower among minority populations. The cost of housing in both urban and rural areas has become increasingly unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income earners. High property and home prices in coastal regions make it hard for residents of even fairly high incomes to buy homes there. Wealthy Americans may own a vacation home in a scenic area or resort.</p>

			<h2>Diet</h2>
			<p>Breakfast can be a traditional meal of eggs, bacon, and toast but is more likely to consist of cold cereal, a piece of fruit, a pastry, or a cup of coffee. A sandwich accompanied by a fruit or vegetable and chips or another side is common cold-lunch fare, though many employed Americans go out to lunch during their midday breaks. Dinner consists of a wide variety of foods and tends to be the largest meal of the day. Meals that can be cooked quickly, including frozen prepared dishes, are common.</p>

			<p>It is difficult to name a national dish. The abundance of fast-food restaurants in the United States would seem to indicate that the national foods are hamburgers, french fries, pizza, and chicken. While these foods are popular among most segments of the population, they reflect a busy lifestyle as much as preference. Many popular “American” foods are adopted from the national cuisines of immigrants; these include Mexican, Chinese, and Italian foods, as well as many others.</p>

			<p>People in the United States eat beef, pork, chicken, and turkey in relatively large quantities. Fresh vegetables and fruits are available year-round. Many people also consume large amounts of “junk food,” including potato chips, soda, candy, and ice cream. Chocolate chip cookies are a common treat. A growing segment of the population is health conscious and eats produce and meat that is organically grown and raised. Most Americans are open to trying new foods, and the culture easily adapts to new tastes.</p>

			<h2>The Arts</h2>
			<p>Galleries and museums nationwide exhibit many art styles and mediums. Government and private organizations provide financial support to artists and art education programs. Larger cities usually have a professional orchestra and at least one theater. New York City is the center of fine arts production in the United States. Broadway musicals are quite popular, and the best tour the nation. The U.S. entertainment industry, including movies and music, is known worldwide. Computer animation and technology contribute to many movies’ visual appeal.</p>

			<p>Pop music is the most common form of music. However, rock and roll (of which there are several styles), jazz, blues, country, bluegrass, rap, and hip-hop all originated in the United States and have large followings. Realistic fiction is the most popular literary form in the country.</p>
