			<h2>Population</h2>
			<p>The population of the United States is the third largest in the world, after China and India. A majority of the population is white. Hispanics (18 percent), also known as Latinos, are the largest minority group, followed by the black population (13 percent). Other groups include Asians and Pacific Islanders (6 percent) and Native Americans and Alaska natives (1 percent). About 3 percent of the population claims more than one race.</p>

			<p>Although members of any ethnic group can be found anywhere in the country, populations vary by region. For example, the majority of the black population lives in the east and southeast, while the majority of Hispanics reside in the west and southwest. In Hawaii, roughly half of the people are Asians or Pacific Islanders. Minority populations also tend to be concentrated in urban areas, where more than 80 percent of all Americans live. About 19 percent of the population is younger than 15 years of age.</p>

			<h2>Language</h2>
			<p>English, the predominant language, is spoken by most citizens. The English spoken in the United States is referred to in other English-speaking nations as American English. It is characterized by unique idioms as well as spelling and pronunciation variations from British English. Spoken English is very flexible, while written English is more formal and standardized. Many immigrants of the first, second, or even third generation also speak their native tongue. In fact, one in five Americans speaks a language other than English in the home, with Spanish being the primary language in the home for roughly 13 percent of all Americans. Native Americans speak a variety of languages.</p>
