			<h2>Government</h2>
			<p>The United States is a democratic federal republic guided by a constitution. The president is both head of government and head of state. The U.S. president is elected by an electoral college, which represents the vote of the people in each state. Presidential elections are held every four years.</p>

			<p>The bicameral legislature, called Congress, has two houses: the 435-seat House of Representatives, whose members serve two-year terms, and the 100-seat Senate, whose members serve six-year terms. Congress is dominated by the right-wing Republican and left-wing Democratic parties. Smaller parties are active throughout the country.</p>

			<p>The government also has a separate judicial branch. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority. Its justices are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate.</p>

			<p>Individual states hold sovereignty over their territory and have all rights that are not reserved by the federal government. Each state has its own legislature for enacting laws. Free elections have always determined the country's leadership, and citizens may vote at age 18.</p>

			<h2>Health</h2>
			<p>The health problems facing Americans are different from those in some other countries, in that the two greatest causes of adult health problems are a sedentary lifestyle and risky physical behavior, such as smoking and illegal drug use.</p>

			<p>The United States is the only industrialized country in the world without a national (public) healthcare system. Because health care is expensive, most Americans rely on private health insurance to pay medical costs. Some people have been unable to afford or to purchase this insurance, but the 2010 Affordable Care Act has made health care more widely available, particularly to people with lower incomes or pre-existing conditions. However, many Americans are opposed to the law, in part because it has driven up the cost of some insurance premiums.</p>

			<p>The health network is extensive and modern, except in some rural areas. Each state has its own regulations regarding health care, and there are some national standards as well. The United States is a world leader in medical research and training.</p>
