			<p>My hobby is not art, but I put that picture because I thought it was funny. I don't know what my career path will really be, but I do plan to evade my taxes whenever possible. I don't like Nickelback, but I do like hating on Nickelback. I play a lot of sports (all of them in fact), so I put a picture of a lot of sports in the sports section. I put a picture of Electro as my picture because I am Electro. I live in Nebraska, a very dangerous place, so I put a picture representing the dangers of Nebraska. My favorite celebrity is baby Sidon because he has a cute smile. The picture of the dog I put in the animal section is a maltese-pomeranian, and the dog in the picture closely resembles my own dog. My favorite food is any food that comes out of an Easy Bake Oven&trade;.</p>
