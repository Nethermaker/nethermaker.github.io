     <h2>Creative Map</h2>
     <p>The main focus of this project was to learn how to use image maps. We linked pictures on a nav to websites. I think I did a good job making sure my image maps lined up with the images I used.</p>
     <p>I think I could have improved this by adding more color to the page. The image map that goes with the Google logo isn't totally aligned, either.</p>

      <h2>Animal</h2>
      <p>In this mini web project we used all the skills we had learned thus far and put them together. This included ID links, and a horizontal nav and image map linking to separate pages. I feel I did a good job with the color scheme and organizing my content.</p>
      <p>At the time we did this project, we had learned little to no CSS, so the only real changes I made here were with colors. I would have liked to do more to change the overall layout, and my home page was also rather lacking in information.</p>

      <h2>My Life</h2>
      <p>In this project, I made a mostly-serious website about my life. A layout style sheet was provided for us, but we had to create all content and other styles, such as fonts, colors, spacing, etc. I also had extra time to work on this, so I added animations to the nav that I really like.</p>
      <p>I struggled to find a color for the headings that matched the color scheme of the rest of the page, and I'm still not totally satisfied with what I settled on. Aside from that, I'm very happy with how this project turned out.</p>

      <h2>Gallery</h2>
      <p>This was a quick little not-very-serious project we did to practice working with tables. We learned how to make tables in HTML, and how to style them with CSS. We also learned how use CSS to make and style columns.</p>
      <p>If I were to improve this, I would probably replace all the pictures with more serious ones. I would also totally re-do the color scheme, since I really don't like the one I ended up using.</p>

      <h2>Country</h2>
      <p>This was the final project for our class. The goal was to design an informational page about a country of choice, completely from scratch. We were allowed to take information directly from CultureGrams, since the focus of the project was on design rather than content. Other than that, no resources were provided. I used everything I learned throughout the class</p>
      <p>I missed some class worktime for this project, so it's not as fancy as I would have liked to make it otherwise. Still, I'm happy with how it ended up looking, and I like the way I organized and styled it.</p>
