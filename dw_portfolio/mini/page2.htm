			<h2 id='appearance'>Physical Appearance</h2>
			<p>One of the main distinguishing features between Amur Leopards and other types of leopards is the Amur Leopard's coat. The Amur Leopard's coat is generally much paler than the coats of other leopards. Its coat also greatly helps it stay warm during the winter, growing from 2.5 cm in the summer to 7 cm in the winter. The Amur Leopard also has longer legs than other leopards, which likely helps it walk more easily through the snow. Adult males typically weigh 32-48 kg, while adult females weigh around 25-43 kg.</p>
			
			<h2 id='behavior'>Behavior and Social Interactions</h2>
			<p>The Amur Leopard is generally nocturnal, meaning it hunts at night and sleeps during the day. When it gets a kill, it tends to hide whatever it doesn't eat, so that its leftovers are not stolen by other animals. Although Amur Leopards tend to be rather solitary, they have been recorded to stay with females after mating, and helping to raise the young. It is also possible that several males may pursue a female, and fight each other over it.</p>
			
			<h2 id='habitat'>Habitat</h2>
			<p>The Amur Leopard can theoretically be found in temperate forest habitats, but the only known population left lives in eastern Russia. Its habitat can experience a very large range of weather and climate conditions, but the Amur Leopard is known to be able to adapt to nearly any environment, so long as it has access to a sufficient level of food and provides it with the ability to hide itself.</p>
			
			<h2 id='diet'>Diet</h2>
			<p>The Amur Leopard is purely carnivorous, meaning that it will only eat meat. It tends to prey on larger animals, such as roe deer, sika deer, and wild boars. If it is able to catch and kill them, it will also eat hares, badgers, racoon dogs, fowl, mice, and sometimes even young black bears.</p>
