			<h2>YouTube</h2>
			<p>YouTube is a site made for sharing videos with the world, and it's open to everyone for free. Whether you want to upload a home video or a professional documentary, YouTube has you covered.</p>
			
			<h2>Facebook</h2>
			<p>Facebook is a social media site, built for keeping up with friends and family no matter where you are. Whether you're wishing someone a happy birthday, uploading pictures of your recent vaction, or playing FarmVille, Facebook is always there for you.</p>
			
			<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
			<p>Wikipedia is the world's largest online encyclopedia, containing an endless amount of informative articles about anything you could imagine. Wikipedia can give you more information than you'd ever want if you're doing anything from writing a scientific paper to making a website about the top five websites in the world.</p>
			
			<h2>Yahoo!</h2>
			<p>Although its search engine is certainly outclassed by Google, Yahoo! is still a popular general use website. Yahoo! covers countless news topics, and also hosts an email service that is rather popular today.
