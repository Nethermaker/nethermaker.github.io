			<h1>nethermaker.github.io</h1>
			<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. This is mostly meant to be a showcase of the things I've learned and/or accomplished in the programming classes I've taken at school. I might use it for other things in the future, but for now it's going to remain relatively simple.</p>

			<h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
			<p>I've taken one web-related class at school (Web Page Programming), where I learned HTML/CSS. Towards the end of the class, we created a portfolio in order to showcase each of the five projects we did throughout the term. The portfolio itself explains each of these projects in detail, so I'm just going to leave a link to it <a href='dw_portfolio/index.htm' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Python</h2>
			<p>I've taken two general programming classes at school (Intro to Computer Programming & Advanced Computer Programming), in which we learned the basics of programming in Python. Most of the stuff we did in these classes isn't worth mentioning (mostly learning and then applying new concepts on small scales), but our final for the second class was to make a game using PyGame. I decided to attempt to recreate Guitar Hero III within PyGame, and ended up being mostly successful. You find the source code, along with more details <a href='https://github.com/Nethermaker/PyHero' target='_blank'>here</a>. Otherwise, if you just want to see how it plays, you can check out the below video.</p>
