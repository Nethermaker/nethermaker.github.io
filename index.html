			<h1>nethermaker.github.io</h1>
			<p>Hello, and welcome to my Github page! This is a collection and demonstration of some of the projects I've worked on in school or on my own. I have links to each project that I've done, as well as short videos that demonstrate what each one is about. If you want to view my Github profile, you can find it <a href='https://github.com/Nethermaker'>here</a>, otherwise you can simply read on!</p>

			<h2>C#/Unity</h2>
			<p>I spent a semester during my senior year of high school doing an independent study on C#, and subsequently applying it in Unity, a free game engine. The result of this work was a small (but mostly complete) 3D platformer based on an old game called Marble Blast, which I aptly named "Not Marble Blast." It was fun to not only learn a new programming language, but to also apply it to developing a game in a 3D engine, something that was new for me. Since I was mostly focused on the programming aspect of this, I did neglect other parts of the game, primarily art and sound. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed making this project, and am very happy with how it turned out. If I have time at some point in the future, I may revisit this in order to brush it up and perhaps expand it. For now, you can take a look at the <a href='https://github.com/Nethermaker/not-marble-blast'>source</a> (I did my best to comment the code extensively), download a <a href='https://github.com/Nethermaker/not-marble-blast/releases/'>Windows build</a> of the game, or simply watch a short demo of it below</p>

			<h2>Python</h2>
			<p>I took two general programming courses in high school, in which I learned the basics of programming in Python. Our final project for these classes was to create a game using PyGame, a game engine/library for Python. I decided to attempt to recreate Guitar Hero III within PyGame. I realized that this task was beyond the scope of what PyGame was probably meant to be used for, but I was mostly successful in my attempt. You find the source code, along with a write-up about the difficulties I faced while creating this, <a href='https://github.com/Nethermaker/PyHero' target='_blank'>here</a> and/or watch the demonstration video below.</p>

			<h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
			<p>In high school I took one web design course, where I learned the basics of HTML/CSS. We did multiple small projects throughout the course, which all built upon each other, and at the end of the course we combined them into a digital portfolio. I won't go into detail about each of the individual projects, since the portfolio describes them each in detail. I also created the website you're looking at now using what I learned in the class. If you want to take a look at the portfolio, you can do just that <a href='dw_portfolio/index.htm' target='_blank'>here</a>, and a link to this page's source can be found in the footer below.</p>

			<h2>Afterword</h2>
			<p>If you've read this far, I just want to thank you for taking the time to read this! It means a lot to me that someone can see some of the things I've created, and I hope that you found something interesting here.
